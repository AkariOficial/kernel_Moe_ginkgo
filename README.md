##### A brief explanation of what is KSU(KernelSU)

> **KernelSU is a kernel-based rooting solution for Android devices. It provides kernel-based root and su access management and an overlayfs-based module system. Officially, KernelSU supports Android GKI 2.0 devices (with 5.10+ kernel) and older kernels (4.14+), although kernel build is required for compatibility.**
